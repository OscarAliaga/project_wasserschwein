ðŸ“‚ Simple Random Experiments

Explanation:
A random experiment is one in which the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty. However, it is possible to identify the possible outcomes and their relative probabilities.

Example:
- Flipping a coin â†’ heads or tails
- Spinning a roulette wheel with 3 colors â†’ each color has a 1/3 probability

Activity:
a) Draw a roulette wheel with 4 sections of different colors.
b) What is the probability of each color coming up?
c) What would happen if one color occupies half of the wheel?

Discuss as a group how the number of possible outcomes influences probability.
