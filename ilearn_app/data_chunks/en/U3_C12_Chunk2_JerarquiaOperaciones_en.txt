ðŸ“‚ Order of Operations

Explanation:
The correct order to solve operations is:
1. Parentheses
2. Multiplication and division (from left to right)
3. Addition and subtraction (from left to right)

Example:
5 + 3 Ã— 2 = 5 + 6 = 11
(5 + 3) Ã— 2 = 8 Ã— 2 = 16

Activity:
Solve applying the order of operations:
a) 4 + 6 Ã— 2 =  
b) (4 + 6) Ã— 2 =  
c) 18 Ã· 3 + 2 =  
d) 18 Ã· (3 + 2) =
