ðŸ“˜ Chunk 1: Exercises from the Teacher's Guide (Chapter 1, Unit 1)
Purpose: Understand the place value of numbers up to the millions and practice their comparison and decomposition.

1. Reading and writing large numbers:
- Read out loud the number: 5,263,084.
- Write it out in words.
- Which digit is in the hundred thousands place?
- What is the place value of the digit 6 in 5,263,084?

2. Additive and canonical decomposition:
- Decompose the number 8,430,726 additively.
- Then write it in its canonical form.

3. Comparison and ordering:
- Arrange the following numbers from smallest to largest: 2,537,019 - 3,507,219 - 2,999,321 - 1,432,765.
- Use >, <, or = to compare:
  a) 7,805,231 ___ 7,815,320
  b) 6,430,111 ___ 6,430,110

4. Relative and absolute value:
- What is the absolute value of the digit 9 in 2,491,372?
- And its relative value?

5. Applied exercise:
- The population of three districts is as follows:
  A: 3,245,219 - B: 2,984,023 - C: 3,245,218
  Which one has more inhabitants? Which ones have almost the same population?
