ðŸ“‚ Composition and Decomposition

Explanation:
Decomposing a number means expressing it as the sum of its place values. Composing is forming the number from those values.

Example:
345,210 = 300,000 + 40,000 + 5,000 + 200 + 10

Activity (student):
Complete the composition and decomposition tables with the given numbers. Then, create two new examples.
