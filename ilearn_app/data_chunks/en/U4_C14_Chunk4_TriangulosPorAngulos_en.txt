Explanation:
According to their internal angles, triangles can be:
- Acute-angled: three acute angles
- Right-angled: one right angle
- Obtuse-angled: one obtuse angle

Activity:
a) Draw examples of each type
b) Use the protractor to verify the angles
c) Classify the following triangles according to their measurements: 60Â°, 60Â°, 60Â° / 30Â°, 60Â°, 90Â° / 120Â°, 30Â°, 30Â°
