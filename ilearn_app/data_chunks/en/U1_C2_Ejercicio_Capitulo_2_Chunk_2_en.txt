Chapter 2 - Chunk 2 of 2: Multiplication by 2 digits (algorithm and problem-solving)

🧠 Activity 4: Application of the algorithm
4a) Solve 38 × 57 using the standard algorithm.
4b) Calculate 25 × 70 following Sofia's idea (multiply by 0 and then by 7).
4c) Now, try Juan's strategy (multiply by 7 and add the zero).

🧮 Activity 5: Two-step problems
5a) Juan makes 45 decorations, each requiring 24 cm of ribbon. How much ribbon does he need?
→ Multiply and explain the process.

5b) He buys 20 pencils at $98 each. How much does he pay?
→ Estimate first, then use the algorithm.

🔁 Activity 6: Comparison of procedures
6a) Compare the results of 35 × 70 and 70 × 35. Are they equal?
→ Argue using the commutative property.

📘 Reinforcement:
• Mastery of the traditional algorithm
• Analysis of common errors (such as incorrect alignment)
• Application of multiplication in real contexts

🧑‍🏫 Teacher's suggestion: Evaluate understanding through oral activities before solving written exercises.
