ðŸ“‚ Conventional Multiplication Algorithm

Explanation:
The standard algorithm organizes the partial products of each digit of the second factor, adding them up correctly aligned according to their positional value.

Example:
  123
Ã—  45
-----
  615   (123 Ã— 5)
+4920   (123 Ã— 40)
-----
 5535

Activity:
