ðŸ“‚ Common Mistakes and Strategies

Common mistakes:
- Omitting the zero in the quotient, for example: 607 Ã· 6 â†’ writing 11 instead of 101.
- Not aligning the digits correctly in the algorithm.

Strategies to avoid mistakes:
- Verify each step with inverse multiplication.
- Use diagrams or tables to represent the process.
- Read each step of the division out loud.

Activity:
Compare the results of:
a) 804 Ã· 4 (correct)
b) 804 Ã· 4 (zero omitted)

What is the difference? Why is that zero important?
