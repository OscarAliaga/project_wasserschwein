ðŸ“‚ Interpretation of the average in real contexts

Explanation:
The average allows obtaining a representative value, but it does not show all the characteristics of the set (it does not indicate variability).

Example:
A student has these grades: 6, 4, 4  
Mean = 4.67  
â†’ Although they have a high grade, the average does not exceed 5.

Activity:
a) Analyze this situation:
Three friends run 100 m in 12 s, 14 s, and 16 s. What is their average? How fair is it to say "they all run in 14 s"?

b) Create a situation with 5 data points and calculate their mean.
