Problem:
A box contains 24 pencils. If the school buys 36 boxes, how many pencils will it have in total?

Step-by-step solution:
1. We multiply 36 × 24.
2. We use the traditional algorithm:
   - 36 × 4 = 144
   - 36 × 20 = 720
   - Total: 144 + 720 = 864

Final answer:
The school will have 864 pencils.
