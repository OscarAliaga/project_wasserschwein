ðŸ“Œ Guide No. 14: Lengths and Congruences
Unit: Unit 3
Chapters: Chapter 4 â€“ Length (m, cm, mm, km + conversions) and Chapter 14 â€“ Congruence (with geometric transformations)

ðŸ”¹ Worked Learning Objectives (OA):
- OA18: Congruence through translation, reflection, and rotation
- OA19: Measurement of lengths with standardized units

ðŸ”¹ Activities:
- Exercises on unit conversion: km, m, cm, mm
- Problems with real-life situations (distances, lengths)
- Identification and analysis of congruent figures through transformations

ðŸ’¡ Expected Assessment:
Practical application of units of measurement and use of geometric transformations to recognize congruence in figures in the environment.
