ðŸ“˜ Chunk 2: Exercises from the Student Text (Chapter 1, Unit 1)
Objective: Apply knowledge of the decimal numbering system in tasks involving reading, decomposition, and comparison of numbers up to 9 digits.

1. Activity 1 â€“ What number is it?:
- Represent with digits: "Three million two hundred thousand forty-six".
- How many digits does that number have?
- What digit is in the millions place?

2. Activity 2 â€“ Decomposition:
- Write the additive decomposition of: 4,208,015.
- Then, write a different number with the same number of digits and decompose it in canonical form.

3. Activity 3 â€“ Hidden number game:
- What number is formed if you change the 5 to a 9 in 6,500,000?
- And if you remove the digit in the tens of thousands place?

4. Activity 4 â€“ Comparison with place value chart:
- Complete the table with the number 7,892,041.
  Millions | Hundreds of thousands | Ten thousands | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones
  ________ | ___________ | ________ | ____ | _______ | _______ | ________
- Then indicate:
  a) Which digit is the largest?
  b) What does the 8 represent in that number?

5. Challenge Activity â€“ Who has the largest number?:
- Sofia: 8,765,123
- Juan: 8,756,321
- Matias: 8,765,321
Who has the largest number? How do you know?
