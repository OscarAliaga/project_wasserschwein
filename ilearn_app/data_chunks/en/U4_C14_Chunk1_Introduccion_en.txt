ðŸ“˜ Unit 4 - Chapter 14: Angles and Triangles
Thematic Axis: Geometry

Learning Objectives:
- LO 10: Identify and classify triangles according to the measurement of their angles and the length of their sides

Overview:
This chapter introduces the concept of angles and their types (acute, right, obtuse), as well as the classification of triangles by their angles (acute-angled, right-angled, obtuse-angled) and sides (equilateral, isosceles, scalene). Emphasis is placed on using a protractor to measure angles and recognize geometric characteristics in real figures.
