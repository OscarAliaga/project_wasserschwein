ðŸ“Œ Exercise #1
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Operations
Chapter: Multiplication
Topic: Distributive property
Type: Problem solving

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
Nancy wants to put 24 water bottles in portable coolers. Each cooler holds 5 bottles.
a) How many coolers does Nancy need?

âœ… Correct answer:
24 Ã— 5 = (20 + 4) Ã— 5 = (20Ã—5) + (4Ã—5) = 100 + 20 = 120

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
The distributive property is applied to simplify the calculation by multiplying simpler parts.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise #2
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Operations
Chapter: Multiplication
Topic: Commutative property
Type: Problem solving

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
MatÃ­as groups balls into 3 groups of 2 and then into 2 groups of 3. How many balls are there in total?

âœ… Correct answer:
3Ã—2 = 6 = 2Ã—3

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
The order of factors does not affect the product. The commutative property allows for rearranging factors.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise #3
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Operations
Chapter: Multiplication
Topic: Associative property
Type: Problem solving

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
Sara made 4 rows of 6 circles on 5 pages. How many circles did she draw?

âœ… Correct answer:
(4Ã—6)Ã—5 = 24Ã—5 = 120

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
Changing the grouping of factors without changing the product. Ideal for organized calculations.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise #4
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Operations
Chapter: Multiplication and doubling
Topic: Doubles and halves
Type: Contextual application

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
a) Pedro walks 8 blocks to the bakery. How many blocks does he walk round trip?

âœ… Correct answer:
8Ã—2 = 16

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
Application of mental calculation by doubling distances in real contexts.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise #5
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Operations
Chapter: Multiplication by multiples of 10
Topic: Mental calculation
Type: Regularities and patterns

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
Complete the sequence:
18Ã—3 = 54  
180Ã—3 = ?  
1 800Ã—3 = ?  
...

âœ… Correct answer:
Multiplying by powers of 10 shifts the digits to the left by adding zeros:  
180Ã—3 = 540, 1 800Ã—3 = 5 400, etc.

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
Expected to identify multiplicative patterns in multiples of 10 and apply quickly.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise #6
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Operations
Chapter: Multiplication
Topic: Mathematical challenge
Type: Complex problem

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
A photocopier enlarges a text 10 times. It is then projected again 10 times. If the letters measure 2 mm, how much will they measure finally?

âœ… Correct answer:
2 mm Ã— 10 Ã— 10 = 200 mm

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
Application of successive multiplication. Understanding the effect of compound enlargements is expected.
