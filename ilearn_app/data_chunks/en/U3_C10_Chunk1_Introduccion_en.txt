ðŸ“˜ Unit 3 - Chapter 10: Parallelism and Perpendicularity in Figures and Shapes
Theme: Geometry

Learning Objectives:
- LO 9: Identify and describe spatial relationships such as parallelism and perpendicularity between lines and sides of geometric figures and shapes

Overview:
This chapter introduces the concepts of parallelism and perpendicularity through the observation and analysis of flat geometric figures and three-dimensional shapes. The use of tools such as rulers, squares, and geometric software is encouraged to verify these relationships. The goal is for students to be able to describe figures using appropriate geometric language.
