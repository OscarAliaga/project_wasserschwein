ðŸ“‚ Reading and interpreting data

Explanation:
Reading graphs allows you to answer questions about the data, identify patterns, and make decisions. It is important to observe axes, titles, and legends.

Example:
In a bar graph of monthly sales:
- In which month were the most sales made?
- What was the difference between the best and worst month?

Activity:
Observe the following graph (to be constructed in class):
a) Which category has the highest frequency?
b) What can you infer from the change between two days?
c) Could you predict the outcome of the next day?
