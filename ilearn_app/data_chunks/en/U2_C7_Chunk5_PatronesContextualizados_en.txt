ðŸ“‚ Patterns in Real-Life Contexts

Scenarios:
1. Every week, a plant grows by 2 cm. If it measures 5 cm in week 1, how long will it be in week 4?
2. A taxi charges $500 for the first kilometer and $200 for each additional kilometer. What is the total fare for 3 km?

Activity:
a) Create a table representing each scenario
b) Describe the pattern formation rule
c) Predict the outcome for an unspecified case (week 6, 10 km)

Reflection:
Why is it useful to find patterns in everyday life (prices, times, quantities)?
