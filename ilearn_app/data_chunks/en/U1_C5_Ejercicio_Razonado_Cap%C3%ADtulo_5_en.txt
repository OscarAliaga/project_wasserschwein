Problem:
Distribute 816 loaves of bread equally among 4 locations.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Divide 816 ÷ 4
   - 8 ÷ 4 = 2 (hundreds)
   - 1 ten → bring down a 0 → 01 → does not fit, add 0 to the quotient
   - Bring down the 6 → 16 ÷ 4 = 4
   - Result: 204

Final answer:
Each location receives 204 loaves of bread.
