ðŸ“‚ Calculation of the volume of right prisms

Explanation:
To calculate the volume of a right prism, the formula is used:

Volume = length Ã— width Ã— height

Example:
A box measures 5 cm in length, 3 cm in width, and 2 cm in height  
Volume = 5 Ã— 3 Ã— 2 = 30 cmÂ³

Activity:
a) Calculate the volume of a prism with:
1) 4 cm Ã— 2 cm Ã— 5 cm  
2) 6 cm Ã— 3 cm Ã— 1 cm

b) Write down the formula used and verify the result with a graphical representation.
