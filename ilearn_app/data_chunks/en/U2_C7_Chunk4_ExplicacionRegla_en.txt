ðŸ“‚ Identification and explanation of the pattern rule

Explanation:
To discover the rule of a pattern, one observes how a quantity changes from one term to the next. The rule can be:
- Additive (addition or subtraction)
- Multiplicative (multiplication or division)

Example:
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 3      |
| 2     | 6      |
| 3     | 9      |
Rule: multiply by 3

Activity:
a) Determine the rule for this table:
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 1     | 5      |
| 2     | 10     |
| 3     | ___    |

b) What would be the output for input = 6?
