Chapter 1 - Reasoning Exercise

Problem:
Martina read that the population of three districts is as follows:
- District A: 2,504,308 inhabitants
- District B: 3,402,150 inhabitants
- District C: 3,402,105 inhabitants

Question:
Which district is the most populous? Which is the least populous?

Step-by-step resolution:
1. Look at the millions: B and C have 3 million, A only has 2 million → A is the least populous.
2. Compare B (3,402,150) with C (3,402,105):
   - Both have 3,402,1__ → compare the last digits: 50 vs 05
   - 150 > 105 → B is the most populous.

Final answer:
District B is the most populous and District A is the least populous.
