ðŸ“‚ Predictions and Recording Results

Explanation:
Predictions can be made before conducting a random experiment, and then the actual results can be recorded for comparison.

Example:
We expect that when rolling a die 12 times, each number will come up 2 times, but in practice it may vary.

Activity:
a) Toss a coin 20 times and record the results  
b) Compare your initial prediction with the actual result  
c) Were they the same? What explanation can you give?

Reflection:
Why is it useful to know probability in games, decisions, or weather predictions?
