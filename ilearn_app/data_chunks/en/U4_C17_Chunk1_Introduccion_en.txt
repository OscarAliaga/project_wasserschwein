ðŸ“˜ Unit 4 - Chapter 17: Symmetry and Translation of Figures
Thematic Axis: Geometry

Learning Objectives:
- LO 8: Identify axial symmetry and translation in geometric figures on the plane

Overview:
This chapter explores two fundamental geometric transformations: axial symmetry (or reflection) and translation (displacement). Students learn to identify symmetrical figures and describe translations based on visual patterns, axes, and coordinates. It promotes the development of spatial thinking and geometric visualization.
