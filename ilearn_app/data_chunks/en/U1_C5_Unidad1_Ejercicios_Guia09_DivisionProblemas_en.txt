ðŸ“Œ Exercise #1
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Problems and Numbers
Chapter: Division by 1 digit
Topic: Exact division and with remainder
Type: Problem solving

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
Alicia has 255 chocolates, 128 candies, and 315 cookies. She wants to make bags to sell them.
a) How many bags with 4 chocolates can she make? Are there any chocolates left over?
b) How many bags with 6 candies can she make? Are there any candies left over?
c) How many bags with 8 cookies can she make? Are there any cookies left over?

âœ… Correct answer:
a) 255 Ã· 4 = 63 bags, 3 chocolates left over
b) 128 Ã· 6 = 21 bags, 2 candies left over
c) 315 Ã· 8 = 39 bags, 3 cookies left over

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
The student should apply division with one-digit divisors, interpret the quotient and remainder, and verify using inverse multiplication.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise #2
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Problems and Numbers
Chapter: Division by 1 digit
Topic: Equitable distribution with remainders
Type: Problem solving

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
A group of 135 young people wants to form 8 teams for an alliance competition. How many young people will each alliance have? How many are needed to complete the team with the fewest members?

âœ… Correct answer:
135 Ã· 8 = 16 per team, 7 young people left over. 1 more is needed to complete the 9th team.

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
The student is expected to relate the remainder to the need to add or balance groups to achieve equality.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise #3
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Problems and Numbers
Chapter: Division by 1 digit
Topic: Division in different contexts
Type: Problem solving

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
A bakery delivers 120 cakes in one day.
a) If they are packaged in trays of 3 units, how many trays are needed?
b) If they are packaged in trays of 6 units, how many are required?

âœ… Correct answer:
a) 120 Ã· 3 = 40 trays
b) 120 Ã· 6 = 20 trays

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
The student should identify how changing the grouping unit affects the quantity of containers required.

ðŸ“Œ Exercise #4
Unit: Unit 1 â€“ Problems and Numbers
Chapter: Division by 1 digit
Topic: Division with unknown in the dividend
Type: Problem solving

ðŸ”¹ Statement:
Esteban has a crate with 350 apples and a bag with a few more. If he wants to distribute his apples among 8 friends so that each receives an equal amount, how many apples should he add from his bag?

âœ… Correct answer:
350 Ã· 8 = 43 with a remainder of 6. 2 apples are needed to reach 44 equal apples â†’ he needs to add 2 apples.

ðŸ’¡ Expected explanation (feedback):
This problem requires interpreting the remainder as the basis to adjust the total to the nearest multiple. It requires inverse thinking.
