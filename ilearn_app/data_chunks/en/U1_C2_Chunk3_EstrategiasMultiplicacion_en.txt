ðŸ“‚ Multiplication Strategies

Explanation:
There are various strategies for multiplication, such as:
- Additive decomposition: 34 Ã— 12 = (30 + 4) Ã— 12 = 30Ã—12 + 4Ã—12
- Use of area: Graphically represent rectangles with length and width according to the factors
- Use of commutative and distributive properties

Worked example:
27 Ã— 14 = (20 + 7) Ã— 14 = (20 Ã— 14) + (7 Ã— 14) = 280 + 98 = 378

Suggested activity:
Apply two different strategies to solve:
a) 23 Ã— 15
b) 46 Ã— 12

Discuss which one was simpler and why.
