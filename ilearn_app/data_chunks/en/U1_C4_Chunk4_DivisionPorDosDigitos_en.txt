ðŸ“‚ Division by two digits

Explanation:
Dividing by two digits requires a good estimation of the partial quotient and verification through inverse multiplication.

Example:
754 Ã· 24 â‰ˆ approximated by 24 Ã— 30 = 720 â†’ quotient 30

Activity:
Calculate:
a) 832 Ã· 26
b) 1,104 Ã· 48

Use estimated multiplications to find the quotient.
