ðŸ“‚ Bar and Line Graphs

Explanation:
- Bar graphs show comparisons between categories.
- Line graphs represent data that changes over time (trends).

Example:
Bar graph showing the number of books read per day.
Line graph showing daily temperature over a week.

Activity:
a) Create a bar graph with the following table:
| Day       | Books |
|----------|--------|
| Monday  | 2       |
| Tuesday | 3       |
| Wednesday| 5     |

b) Draw a line graph with the temperature (Â°C) over 5 days:
Mon: 15 â€“ Tue: 17 â€“ Wed: 18 â€“ Thu: 16 â€“ Fri: 19
