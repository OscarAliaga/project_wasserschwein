ðŸ“‚ Application in geometric figures and shapes

Explanation:
In flat figures such as rectangles, squares, and trapezoids, pairs of parallel or perpendicular sides can be identified.

In solid shapes such as cubes, prisms, and parallelepipeds, these relationships between edges can also be found.

Activity:
a) Mark pairs of parallel and perpendicular edges on a cube  
b) In a trapezoid, identify which sides are parallel and which are not  
c) Build a 3D model using sticks or cardboard and identify geometric relationships
