ðŸ“‚ Division Algorithm with Zeros in the Quotient

Explanation:
When dividing a number, if a digit in the quotient should be zero, it should not be omitted. The 0 maintains the correct positional value.

Example:
607 Ã· 6:
- 6 fits into 6 â†’ 1
- 6 does not fit into 0 â†’ write 0
- 6 fits into 7 â†’ 1
â†’ Result: 101

Activity:
Solve using the algorithm and write all the steps:
a) 403 Ã· 4
b) 709 Ã· 7
c) 802 Ã· 8

Discuss with a partner: What would happen if you do not include the 0 in the quotient?
