ðŸ“˜ Unit 1 - Chapter 3: Length Measurement - "Making tapes"
Thematic Axis: Geometry and Measurement

Learning Objectives:
- LO 12: Measure, estimate, and record lengths in millimeters, centimeters, meters, and kilometers
- LO 13: Solve problems involving the conversion of length units

Chapter Overview:
This chapter introduces length measurement in units of the metric system. The aim is for students to understand the use of different instruments (ruler, tape measure), recognize equivalences between units, and apply this knowledge to real contexts such as measuring tapes, distances, or structures.
