Retrieval practice involves actively recalling information from memory, which:\n\n- Strengthens memory traces\n- Improves long-term retention\n- Enhances understanding and transfer of knowledge\n\nWhen a child is asked to teach or explain something they learned:\n\n- They reconstruct the knowledge in their own words\n- They engage in elaborative rehearsal, which is more effective than passive review\n- They boost metacognitive awareness (awareness of what they know)\n\nüëâ *Teaching others‚Äîeven pretend teaching‚Äîhas been shown to be particularly powerful because it forces learners to organize and clarify their understanding* (Fiorella & Mayer, 2013).",
